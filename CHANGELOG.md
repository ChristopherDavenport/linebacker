Many thanks to Jakub Koz≈Çowski and Taylor Brown for their contributions to this release.

Updates for new features available in upstream libraries.

- [#32](https://github.com/ChristopherDavenport/linebacker/pull/32) Uses utilities exposed via `ContextShift` to provide the shifting construct in a non-implementation dependent way(such that fairness guarantees of the context may not make asumptions valid).
- [#29](https://github.com/ChristopherDavenport/linebacker/pull/29) Added capability to use a configurable `ThreadFactory` to generate the `ExecutorService`'s.
- [#23](https://github.com/ChristopherDavenport/linebacker/pull/23) `DualContext` now extends `Linebacker` as it has the capability to operate as either construct.
- [#19](https://github.com/ChristopherDavenport/linebacker/pull/19) `ExecutorService` exposed as resources not as Streams.

Dependencies:

- cats-effect 1.0.0
- Dropped fs2 dependency
